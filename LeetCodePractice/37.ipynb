    "\n",
    "We define a isValid function that checks if a given character is valid in a given row, column, and 3x3 sub-box.\n",
    "We define a backtrack function that uses a recursive approach to solve the Sudoku. It first finds the first empty cell, and then tries all possible numbers from 1 to 9. For each number, it checks if it is valid in the current cell using the isValid function. If it is valid, it places the number in the cell and recursively solves the remaining cells. If the solution is found, it returns True. If not, it backtracks and tries the next number. If all numbers are tried and none of them work, it returns False.\n",
    "Finally, we call the backtrack function to solve the Sudoku. The solution is modified in-place in the input board variable."
